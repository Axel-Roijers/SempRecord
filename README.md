# SempRecord - Your Favorite Worklogger

SempRecord is a desktop application designed to help you record your work sessions without interrupting your workflow. 
It allows you to choose which apps to record and optimizes the encoding profiles to create high-quality videos that take up less space on your hard drive. 
With SempRecord, you can easily create timelapses of your workday that look like carefully edited videos.


## Features

- Always standby to record any apps of your choosing without disturbing your workflow.
- Optimized encoding profiles will crush an 8 hour workday into a 5.4GB file while maintaining a high quality image.
- Breaks in your workflow are not recorded, and the records may be much smaller depending on your content.
- In other words, if nothing is happening on screen, nothing is recorded.

- Output will look like carefully edited timelapses without any breaks.
